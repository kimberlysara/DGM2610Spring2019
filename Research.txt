The game Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze has a similar design in certain levels of the game. 
Subway Surfers:Subway Surfers is an infinite runner that I think has a similar objective to my game because your are trying to escape authority. I think some of the negative of this app is that you need to do in-app purchases
to get extra coins and there are a lot of ads on the app. 
Super Mario Run:Super Mario Run is another infinite runner, this one, like mine, is more of a sidescroller. The objective is to get to the end of the level in time without falling off the screen.
This is similar to mine in that way because for mine you have to be quick enough jumping over gaps and fences so you aren't caught be the police. I think this is a really well made game, it has a lot of unique level designs
